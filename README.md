FogJS
=======

**FogJS** brings the cloud down to earth by adding a few features and abstractions to the Node.js Windows Azure API.

Building Azure apps with FogJS that need to interact with Azure Table Storage, Blob Storage, Queue Storage, Caching, and/or the Service Bus is very easy. 
The examples that follow use this approach. Fog also provides more fine-grained interaction if that is desired, but adds a few features such as promises. 
See the integration tests for examples.
